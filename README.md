A client helper mod

**Attention!!**

I personally used this mod only on servers where client modes were not prohibited. 
Obey the server rules and don't use this mod if autoclickers, macros or another automation tools were banned on the server



**Usage:**

type "info" in game console to see the list of available commands

**What mod can do:**

  1) Automatic crafting
  2) Automatic mining and smelting
  3) Automatic forestry
  4) Automatic foraging and botanizing
  5) Some tools for automatic inventory items management
  6) Automatic item improving
  7) Another various things, making the gameplay easier
  
  
I did my best in making the command and bot descriptions as clear as possible. 
But there can be errors and I will be glad if you tell me in case you find some.
